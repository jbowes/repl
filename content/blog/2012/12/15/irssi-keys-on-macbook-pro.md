title: IRSSI Keys on a MacBook Pro
---

At [$newjob](http://www.goinstant.com/) I'm using a late 2011 MacBook Pro, so
I've had to relearn some keys for [IRSSI](http://www.irssi.org/). The
important ones to me are:  
  
  

  * fn + up arrow / down arrow: for viewing the backscroll (page up / page down)
  * Setting an option key to "+esc" under iTerm2 so I can hold down the key and use left and right arrows to move through open windows.
