After nearly seven years, Friday marked my last day at [Red
Hat](http://www.redhat.com/). I'm taking a week off to focus on growing my
beard and [brewing](http://hopville.com/recipe/1651119)
[a](http://hopville.com/recipe/1664369)
[lot](http://hopville.com/recipe/1664372), before starting my next adventure.  
  
If you need to reach me, I'm still on teh internets.
