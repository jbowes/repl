[Side View](http://flic.kr/p/bvbdot): _The side of a slab of pork_

_belly is __ quite obviously delicious_

_bacon, only raw._  
  
A few weeks ago I acquired a slab of pork belly from a local [Nova Scotian
farmer](http://www3.ns.sympatico.ca/naturesscriptfarm/), with the intention of
making [Bacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon) from scratch. Plenty of
different cuts of meat preserved in different ways can be qualified as bacon;
I decided on typical North American pork belly, salt cured and smoked.  
  
Making bacon is pretty easy, if a little time consuming. All you need is:  
  
  

  * A slab of pork belly
  * Salt (table or kosher. sea salt is too coarse)
  * A smoker
  * Wood

[Salt Curing](http://flic.kr/p/bvbiBK)  
I **salt cured **the pork belly by covering it in salt and storing it in a
glass container for 5 days (actually two containers, the belly was so big I
had to cut it to fit into the containers I had available). I coated the pork
belly in salt on both sides, then rubbed it in with my hands. Each day after
first draining any excess liquid out of the container I repeated the salting.  
  
The curing stage is a good time to add any additional seasonings to the bacon,
like brown sugar or maple syrup. For my first batch of bacon I decided to
pass.  
  
After the bacon had cured for 5 days (and when I had enough time in the day to
watch the smoker), I **smoked** the bacon. I used my home-made [flower pot
smoker](http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2008/07/05/the-alton-brown-flower-pot-
smoker/) and cherry wood chips that were soaked in water overnight. The bacon
stayed on the smoker for about 8 hours, at 200Â°F. Since I'd be frying the
bacon before eating it, I wasn't concerned about under-cooking it.

[Smoking the bacon](http://flic.kr/p/bvbtve)  
After the bacon was smoked, I put it in the fridge for about half an hour to
let the meat rest, and to let it firm up before cutting. I cut the bacon with
my sharpest cutting knife. A deli slicer would have been nice here. And that's
it! The pork belly was now bacon, and ready to be fried and eaten.  
  
It was a good first attempt; the bacon is tender and has a great smoky
flavour, but is a bit too salty. The salt and smoke flavour does make it great
as an ingredient to other dishes though, like omeletts and soup. Next time
I'll try to reduce the salt content, probably by wiping off any excess salt
each day, when I drain off the juices.
