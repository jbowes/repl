title: Using 960.gs, Haml, Sass, and Compass on Blogger
---

I tried to see how many cool toys I could use to create my own
[blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) template. So far I have:  
  

  * [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/) for a nice 2 column layout.
  * [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for the unstyled template.
  * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for style.
  * [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) to tie it all together.
You can find the result on github, [here](https://github.com/jbowes/repl-960
-haml-blogger).  
  
Any readers who have noticed a similarity in chosen technology to those used
by [Katello](http://katello.org/) get bonus points!
