title: Micro USB for Power Everywhere
---

One of the reasons I'm very excited for  [Rasberry
Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is that it uses [micro
USB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_Micro_connectors) for power.
This is also the standard may cell phone manufacturers are [settling
on](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7894763.stm?lss) for charging. I
would love to see more every day devices use micro USB for charging and for
power. Granted, not all devices can run off the 100mA from USB 2.0 (or charge
at a reasonable rate), but I can eliminate just one more of those odd coaxial
chargers, I'd be a happy fellow.
