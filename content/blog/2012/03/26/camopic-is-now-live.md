My new app, [Camopic](http://bit.ly/camopic), is now live on Google Play (only
$0.99! cheap!). Camopic uses
[steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) to hide a picture
inside a different jpeg image. You can then share that image with another
Camopic user, who will be able to reveal and view your hidden image.  
  
This basically sums it up:
