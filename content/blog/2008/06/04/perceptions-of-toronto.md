---

Growing up on the east coast of Canada,
[this](http://torontoist.com/2008/06/vice_to_zune_mu.php) is how I imagined
Toronto to be, like, 24/7.  
  
I've been here for nine months or so, and have yet to be invited to any trendy
[VICE](http://vice.typepad.com/vice_magazine/canada/index.html) parties. Just
so you know, VICE, I am very willing to grow out some stubble and wear vintage
clothing or an ironic t-shirt for the event.  
  
Toronto is great though, even without the free Red Stripe.
