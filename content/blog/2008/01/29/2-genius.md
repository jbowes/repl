Agile Tsar [Dmitri Dolguikh](http://appliedlogic.blogspot.com/) pointed out
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) yesterday, which is a website
containing a series of short programming problems. It reads a bit like bonus
questions on a math exam, which is actually quite refreshing compared to the
day-to-day problems at work. For added fun, I'm trying to run through the
problems in [Common Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp).  
  
So far I have completed 4 out of 179 problems, which makes me _2% genius_,
according to the site.
