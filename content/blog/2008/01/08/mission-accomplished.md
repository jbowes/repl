A lot of people are linking to [this article](http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/Cros
sTalk/2008/01/0801DewarSchonberg.html) about the state of the practice in CS
curriculum and its use of Java creating dull replaceable drones.  
  
[mdehaan](http://www.michaeldehaan.net/) points out a wonderful section
wherein the authors relate Java programming to a plumber in a hardware store,
finding pieces and putting them together to solve a problem, rather than their
unmentioned alternative (maybe an artist molding clay?)  
  
If this is true, then we, the software industry and software engineering
fields, are done. We have found the holy grail: true modularity and reusable
software components. Drop whatever language you're using and switch to Java.
