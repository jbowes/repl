title: DIY Velcro Cable Ties
---

[Making your own velcro cable ties](http://www.instructables.com/id/Velcro-
Cable-Ties/) is a great idea. $2 in materials made as many cable ties as Wal-
Mart was selling for $13. Thrifty!  
  
I'd suggest sewing the velcro together vs stapling, especially if you have
cats that are far too curious about staples.
