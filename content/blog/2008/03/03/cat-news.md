Our boy cat
[Julius](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bowes/sets/72157603547669860/) passed
away a few weeks ago. It was pretty shocking, as he was quite young and his
passing was sudden and unexpected. While we miss him terribly, Cherie and I
didn't want
[Spook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bowes/sets/72157603551985363/) to get too
used to being an only cat again.  
  
So this weekend we picked up a new little fellow from the [Toronto Humane
Society](http://www.torontohumanesociety.com/):

Bowes, on Flickr" )  
  
He doesn't have a name yet, but he sure has quite a pair of ears on him!
