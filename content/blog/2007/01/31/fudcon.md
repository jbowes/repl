The [Fedora Users and Developers
Conference](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon) is on Friday. Weather
permitting, I’ll be flying up to Boston to attend tomorrow night.  
  
In no particular order, here are the parts of FUDCon I am looking forward to:  

  

  * Cold Boston weather means I can wear my parka.
  

  * Riding the subway.
  

  * Meeting [Mr. Katz](http://katzj.livejournal.com/) and [Mr. Vidal](http://skvidal.wordpress.com/) in person.
  

  * The [yum](http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/) [hackfest.](http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumHackFestFudCon)
  

  * Getting a free t-shirt.
  
  
I plan to take lots of photos, but I usually forget my camera whenever I go
anywhere, so we’ll see.
