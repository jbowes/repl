[Linspire](http://linspire.com) announced [Click Nâ€™ Run](http://cnr.com)
support for distributions beyond their own the other day. What I find
interesting is the logo for [Freespire](http://freespire.org) shown on the cnr
page, conveniently adjacent to the [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org) logo:  
  
![linux-logos](http://jbowes.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/linux-logos.png)  
  
Obviously, the logos are on the wrong sides of each other. Freespire should be
the left, or _sinister_ twin.
