title: On Sponsored Blog Posts
---

On the [planet](http://planet.cs.dal.ca), a certain blogger has been writing
sponsored blog posts (aka selling out to the man). This blogger is free to do
whatever they feel is acceptable, I suppose. What follows is an infographic
generated from posts made by said blogger since the start of December.

Only 45% of the content is not shilling or about shilling. Imagine watching an
hour long program, only to find out that 33 minutes are commercials.  
  
I can understand the desire to make money, but you actually need people to
read your blog to make money from it. How many people will keep reading when
less than half of the posts contain actual content?
