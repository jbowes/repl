title: How much did wuja cost?
---

I heard about [SLOCCount](http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/) the other day
from [Caolan McNamaraâ€™s](http://blogs.linux.ie/caolan/2006/01/30
/disentangling-ooo-java-build-items/) post on [Fedora
People](http://planet.fedoraproject.org).

  

Besides just counting source lines of code, SLOCCount also outputs some quick
[COCOMO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO) calculations. According to these
figures, [wuja](http://www.dangerouslyinc.com/wuja) cost would around $55,265
to produce if it were written by paid programmers. Pretty neat.
