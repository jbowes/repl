Yup.  
  
[Marc's](http://www.lastblogger.com/archives/217) reply to[ my
chart](http://flame.cs.dal.ca/~bowes/blog.cgi/opinion/greedvmeat.html) is
right on the money. Some of the words I chose were intentionally over the top,
when they probably shouldn't have been. I should also mention that Marc is
someone that I greatly respect, and look up to. I may not agree with how he
chooses to supplement his income (he might not agree with my selling
overpriced board games on ebay, either), but he has every right to do so.  
  
Marc has every right to be on the [planet](http://planet.cs.dal.ca), and to
post whatever he wants on there. He's been more involved with Dal CS than
anyone else, and it would be a shame to lose him. I want to make sure he wants
to be taken off the planet before I remove his feed, and I hope he changes his
mind.  
  
As for this professor, where is their blog? I'm sure it would make a great
addition to the planet.
