At the end of August, Cherie and I (and the cats) will be moving to
[Toronto](http://www.toronto.ca/). I'll still be working with [Red
Hat](http://www.redhat.com) on [RHN](http://rhn.redhat.com); we just decided
it was time to return to [our own Country](http://www.canada.gc.ca).  
  
It should be good times.
