Late last week, the stalwart
[soupnazi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soup_Nazi) n√©e
[jerry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld_%28character%29)
[crashed](http://dangerouslyinc.com/back-online)
[hard](http://dgoodwin.dangerouslyinc.com/stench-hardware-failure-morning),
taking a lot of data with it. Both [Devan](http://dgoodwin.dangerouslyinc.com)
and I have since recovered most of our lost data, but the peculiar thing is
that some hosts are still resolving
[dangerouslyinc.com](http://dangerouslyinc.com) to the old IP (including the
[Dal CS](http://www.cs.dal.ca) machines, which run [the
planet](http://planet.cs.dal.ca)).  
  
DNS is such a dark magic to me. I do not know how it works, nor do I wish to
know.
