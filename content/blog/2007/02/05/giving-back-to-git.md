title: Giving back to git

It must be obvious from [previous](http://jbowes.dangerouslyinc.com/2007/01/26
/git-rebase-keeping-your-branches-current/ "keeping your branches current" )
[posts](http://jbowes.dangerouslyinc.com/2006/12/19/my-gitconfig/ "My
.gitconfig" ) that I love [git](http://git.or.cz "Git Homepage" ). Tonight I
sent a [patch](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-
control.git/38800) to the [mailing list](http://git.or.cz/#community). It's
small and simple; it lets you save options for cvsimport in your config file,
rather than supplying them each time you run it.  
  
Hopefully it will be of use to others.
