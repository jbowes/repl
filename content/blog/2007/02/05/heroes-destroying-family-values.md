If your wife/SO has not yet watched [NBC](http://www.nbc.com)'s
[Heroes](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes) _do not let her!_  
  
My wife, [Devan](http://dgoodwin.dangerouslyinc.com)'s wife, and
[Jeremy](http://katzj.livejournal.com)'s finance all have some sort of a thing
for that [Hiro](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1199811/) character. If your
relationship has not yet been affected by this pandemic, protect yourself, and
stay away from this awesome show.
