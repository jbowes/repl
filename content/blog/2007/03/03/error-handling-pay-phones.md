title: Error Handling & Pay Phones

It's not enough to handle all error cases; you have to respond to them
properly as well.  
  
While waiting in the Ottawa International Airport, I placed a call to my
sister from a pay phone. The number is local, so I entered the seven digits.
The phone's response was to play a recording for me: _"To dial this local
number, you must enter the area code."_ I tried again, entering 1+&lt;area
code&gt;+&lt;local number&gt;, what I had assumed to be the only way to dial a
number with an area code. To this, the phone played another recording: _"This
is a local call. You must not begin the number with a one." _Finally, I dialed
&lt;area code&gt;+&lt;local number&gt;; this worked.  
  
In both failed cases, the phone system detected an error and alerted me, as
well as suggesting the solution. So it did one thing right, and two things
wrong. The suggested solution was not clear enough, but more importantly, the
phone system knew the number I was trying to connect to; it should have
adjusted the number and connected me, without notifying me of any perceived
errors.
