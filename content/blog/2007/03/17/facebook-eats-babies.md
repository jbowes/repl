I've been trying to understand the popularity of
[facebook](http://www.facebook.com) over the past week. In particular, why is
it seemingly more popular than [friendster](http://www.friendster.com) or
[orkut](http://www.orkut.com) (unless you're
[Brazilian](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/?p=3082))?  
  
[Devan](http://dgoodwin.dangerouslyinc.com) phrased it well (using his elite
new irc nick):  
`  
12:39 <@jbowes> facebook is way too much like orkut  
12:40 <@jbowes> or all them other ones  
12:40 <@jbowes> why is it that people seem to like it more?  
12:40 < kryptos> it tries to replace everything  
12:40 < kryptos> we have email  
12:40 < kryptos> we have blogs  
12:40 < kryptos> we have flickr  
12:41 < kryptos> i wouldnt even be on facebook if i didnt have to check email
for plans tonight, and constantly see facebook emails  
12:41 < kryptos> maybe i need to filter them to trash  
`  
  
Facebook wants become the canonical source for your data. It keeps you coming
back with its stream of email. This is reminiscent of the [instant
gratification](http://www.stopmethaddiction.com/) aspects of gambling and
other addictive activities.
