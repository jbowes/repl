Today was a good day, TCB-wise:  

  

  * I finished reading [Fragile Things](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060515228?ie=UTF8&tag=higteclowlif-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060515228) by [Neil Gaiman](http://www.neilgaiman.com/). There are a few really terrible entries in this collection of short stories, but mostly it's a good read.
  

  * Upgraded this blog to the latest [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org), and switched to the [veryplaintxt](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/veryplaintxt/) theme. I'm enjoying the minimalist theme, but Wordpress appears to have eaten a lot of my [tags](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior).
  

  * Submitted [Elixir](http://elixir.ematia.de/) for inclusion in [Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org). Elixir puts an [Active Record](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html) layer on top of [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/), meaning you can do [SQLObject](http://www.sqlobject.org/)-like things with better database support.
  

  * Did some grocery shopping (tortilla chips and cheese count as groceries, right?)
  

  * Put [a router](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ih=012&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&viewitem=&item=220125068980&rd=1&rd=1) on [ebay](http://www.ebay.com).
