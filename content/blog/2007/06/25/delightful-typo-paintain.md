title: 'A delightful typo: Paintain'

While discussing a new software feature, I made the following typo:  
  
`17:56 <@jbowes> and then people would use it, and then we'd have to paintain
it  
17:56 <@jbowes> i meant to type maintain, but that word is awesome  
`  
  
I think _paintain_ aptly describes what many of us do daily.
