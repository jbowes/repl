[system-summary](http://git.dangerouslyinc.com/?p=system-summary;a=summary) is
a little dialog window I whipped up (with help from [Mr.
Goodwin](http://dgoodwin.dangerouslyinc.com)) after talking with Will Woods
about how there is no one place you can send someone to give you basic
information when they file a bug. The idea is that this will be launched from
System/About This Computer.  
  
[system-summary](http://git.dangerouslyinc.com/?p=system-summary;a=summary)
will probably get folded into
[smolt](https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/smolt), but for now it lives
in a [git repository](http://git.or.cz) on [Dangerously
Incompetent](http://dangerouslyinc.com).
