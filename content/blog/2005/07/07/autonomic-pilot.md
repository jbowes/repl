I've become the new build ~~monster~~ master at work. This means  
that I have to keep the nightly builds running, and watch for anything strange  
happening during the unit and functional tests. Should anything peculiar  
happen, I've got to either fix it myself, or find someone who can.  
I will spare you my personal opinion on the effectiveness of assigning one  
person to be the build master.  

  
  

  
The other night, [herk](http://www.fnordia.org) and I were talking  
about my new role. Part of the previous build master's workflow included  
coming in each morning, checking the build and test logs, and composing  
an email summary of the results. The task is almost purely mechanical  
repetition, so I've tasked myself with automating the process. When I told  
herk about this, he said he had thought that the summary emails were  
already generated automatically.  

  
  

  
This reminds me of a [certain
