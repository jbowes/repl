title: I may be anti-plastic, but I'm pro-mannequin
---

  
CBC played the first episode of the new [Doctor
Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/)  
series last  
night; Ms. Vissers and I watched it. I had avoided securing myself an  
unauthorized reproduction of the show, so as to preserve the  
phosphorus glory that is only achieved through the inability to skip  
commercials. Doctor Who is definitely going to be one of my regularly  
watched shows from now on, but I've always had a thing for [British sci-
fi](http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/).  

  
  

  
Oh yeah, and episode six's title is _Dalek_... I quiver with anticipation!
