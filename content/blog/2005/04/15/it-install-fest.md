title: It's an Install Fest!
---

  
The [Dal-ACM](http://www.dal-acm.ca), in conjunction with  
[nSLUG](http://www.nslug.ns.ca), the RAND corporation, and  
the letter 'U' are going to be holding an old-skool Install Fest on  
Saturday, April 30th, from 12 noon till 6pm in the Computer Science  
Building atrium.  

  
  

  
You can check out the  
[details](http://www.dal-acm.ca/Projects/InstallFest),  
or if you're already sold, add your  
name to the  
[list of attendees](http://www.dal-
acm.ca/Projects/InstallFest/TellUsYoureComing).  
I'm gonna bring along a laptop  
chock-full of uber-leet apps, like beagle and luminocity, and there  
will be drinks and nibblies. Should be fun times.  

  
  

  
If you want, you can bring snacks, too. I like M&amp;M's.
