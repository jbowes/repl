title: I'd sell my freedom for a copy of GarageBand
---

  
Trent Reznor put out the  
[whole](http://boss.streamos.com/download/interscope/nin/with_teeth/nin_garage
band.sit)  
of 'the hand that feeds', from the forthcoming NIN album, with teeth, in  
[GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/) format.  
I'm a huge NIN fan (I stood in line down at Sam's  
on Barrington on a Monday night until midnight, so I could get the  
fragile when it was first released), so this makes me very excited.  

  
  

  
On the other hand, I mix and compose music about as well as I play  
sports (which is to say, horribly), so I think I can do without  
playing with GarageBand, and just wait for the album to come out.  

  
  

  
NIN has been around since 1989, so it makes you wonder. Do today's savvy goth
kids still listen to NIN? You could be 14, trying to  
express your dark and depressing inner self, and then find out that mom  
used to listen to NIN. How lame.
