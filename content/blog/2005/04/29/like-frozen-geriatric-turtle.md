I picked up the snackers for the  
[install fest](http://www.dal-acm.ca/Projects/InstallFest/) today.  
The cashier who rang it through was without doubt the slowest cashier who  
ever lived. I'm thinking about going back and giving her a medal or something;  
moving that slow must take an awful lot of discipline.
