title: Announcing the Planet Loyalty Programme
---

  
[Planet Dal CS](http://planet.cs.dal.ca) is nearing  
critical mass; with only a few more subscriptions it will become  
self-sustainable. To help it reach this point, and to reward existing
subscribers to the Planet, I have launched the _Planet Dal CS Subscriber
Loyalty Programme_  

  
  

  
What is the Loyalty Programme?  

  

  * Existing subscribers to Planet Dal CS (henceforth referred to as 'the Planet') as of 04/02/05 receives 100 points towards their account.
  

  * Every entry (or 'post') a subscriber makes to their weblog (henceforth referred to as 'the blog' or 'online journal' or 'electro-diary') earns said subscriber 10 points towards their account.
  

  * Every comment the party of the first part posts to the party of the second part's comment system (if said party offers some form of comment system) in response to a post the party of the second part has made to their blog earns the party of the first part 2 points towards their account. Both parties must be existing subscribers to the Planet.
  

  * Potential parties earn 50 points towards their account for becoming subscribers to the Planet after approval by the Planet's administrators.
  
  

  
  

  
In addition, subscribers may earn points through the _Referral Sub-programme_:  

  

  * If the party of the first part (who must not be a subscriber to the planet) is referred by the party of the second part (who must be an existing, approved member of the Planet) during the process of subscription approval, the party of the second part earns 20 points towards their account. This is in addition to the 50 points regularly earned by the party of the first part towards the party of the first part's account.
  

  * If the party of the first part (who must not be a subscriber to the planet) is referred by the party of the second party (who must be an existing, approved member of the Planet) during the process of subscription approval, and, in addition, the party of the second part, during the process of the approval of their subscription to the planet was referred by the party of the third part (who was and is an existing approved member of the planet during the party of the second part's approval process and the party of the first part's approval process), the party of the third part shall earn 10 points towards their account. This is in addition to the 20 points earned by the party of the second part towards the party of the second part's account, and the 50 points earned by the party of the first part towards the party of the first part's account.
  
  

  
  

  
I hope the rules of the new system are clear to everyone. So let's get out
there and start earning those points!
