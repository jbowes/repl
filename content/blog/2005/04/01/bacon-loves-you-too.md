Here's to a super-fun april 1st. At least one of you got  
punk'd (time zones are no excuse!).  

  
  

  
Three of my favourite pranks this year have to be:  

  

  * [G12 and mandatory donations](http://www.livejournal.com/users/davyd/139147.html)
  

  * [Hipster PDF](http://www.flickr.com/photos/13912462@N00/sets/197119/)
  

  * [How to put on pants](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/productivity/index.php#how-to-put-on-pants-037884)
  
  

  
  

  
And remember kids, lock your workstations!
