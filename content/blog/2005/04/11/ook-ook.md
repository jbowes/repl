O'Reilly's [codeZoo](http://www.codezoo.net) (aliases: CodeOrNot, RateMyHack)  
[launched](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6803)  
last week. It's like  
[Version Tracker](http://www.versiontracker.com) for  
developers, which I think is long overdue. It's rare enough when you  
find someone who isn't writing the 1.456e52th linked-list  
implementation, let alone when you find someone actually using the  
best tool for the job; I blame the universities for this. Hopefully, a  
pretty corporate-backed website with a search feature, advertisements,  
and links to the latest O'Reilly titles will remedy that problem.  

  
  

  
The  
ratings (and maybe the listing of the license) will be the best part of
codeZoo,  
once the site gains some momentum. Hopefully the site's admins will  
cull some of the ratings' comments. "May be the best O/R tool." is not  
useful; you already expressed that with your 5/5 rating.  

  
  

  
Currently, codeZoo is focusing only on Java libraries. Java isn't  
really my cup of tea (heh), though I have been thinking about doing a  
few projects with it, just to try out some of the flash new libraries  
available (especially some of the  
[Jakarta Commons](http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/) bits). Plus, we all  
have to keep our skill sets relevant, right? Maybe I'll find something  
on codeZoo that really piques my interest. Or maybe they'll put some  
python libraries on there first; either way is fine by me.  

  
  

  
One has to wonder though: with all these software ratings sites  
popping up recently, why hasn't [DOAP](http://usefulinc.com/doap) gained more
backing?
