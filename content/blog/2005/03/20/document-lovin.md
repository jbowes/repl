(Apologies to everyone who has heard my PDF rant before.)

Reading PDFs on Linux sucks. That is, it used to suck, until the  
desktop group at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) released  
the result of a weekend hack-fest:
[Evince](http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince).  

  
  

  
Evince is brilliant. The project has only been alive for ~2  
months, but already its the best document viewer available for  
Linux. PDF, PS, images; it does them all (DVI and multi-page TIFF  
coming soon!). Tasty features include: Type-ahead find, page  
thumbnails, document index, and full-screen mode for presentations. I  
have yet to come across another PDF reader for Linux that just lets me  
read my document, without having to deal with UI quirks (this includes  
nasty-pants acroread), the way that Evince does.  

  
  

  
The MacOS X'ers out there are now screaming "What about  
Preview.app?!" (though they may not say 'dot app'). Yes, Apple struck  
gold with Preview; I love it dearly, too. Surely, whatever incremental  
improvements Evince has over Preview will find their way into Mac OS  
10.5,  
["Scottish Fold"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Fold)  
, but it will never be as good as Evince.  
Why, you ask? Well, Ladies and Gentleman, I give you definitive proof as  
to why Preview.app is not as good as Evince:  

  
  

  
Preview doesn't run on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com).
