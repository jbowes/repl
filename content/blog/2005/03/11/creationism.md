[This](http://fuware.nanocrew.net/pymusique/) is  
awesome. Not because I'll use it (I'm all ogg, baby), but because  
these guys wanted an iTunes Music Store interface in Linux (or at  
least wanted to make one), so they did it.  

  
  

  
What's funny is that they also released a Win32 installer. If MacOS X had a
non X11 gtk+ port, I'd totally put out a dmg.
