Not only does the [society](http://www.cssociety.ca)  
regularly offer drinks at criminal prices, now they've put together what  
promises to be the [best. event. ever.](http://torch.cs.dal.ca:2004/~johnston/
twiki/bin/view.cgi/CSSociety/WarehouseBash)  

  
  

  
The lovely Ms. Vissers and I will be attending; I would already  
have my tickets if [Pat](http://www.larocheonline.ca)  
hadn't dropped the ball on that one. A note to  
the organizers: I already own an Xbox and a Game Cube, but I would  
very much like to play Tekken 5. Ms. Vissers owns no game consoles,  
but is quite fond of Super Monkey Ball and Zelda.  

  
  

  
I've added a link to the society's web page from the  
[Planet](http://planet.cs.dal.ca);  
really, it should have been there ages ago.
