In a flurry of productivity, I crafted myself a [web-
site](http://www.cs.dal.ca/~bowes/) to complement the  
blog. Fun facts: It uses neither php nor perl, and there are no  
repeated presentation elements whatsoever. I decided to go with the  
[Cheetah](http://www.cheetahtemplate.org) template system, though I could have
just  
as easily used one of the gajillions of other templating systems for any other
language. It's fun to generate static pages!  

  
  

  
The style is rather austere, though it does look better now than  
the original layout of the blog did. Anyhoo, I welcome all feedback.
