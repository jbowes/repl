title: Have you hugged a developer today?
---

  
A lot of Free software developers end up taking a lot of flack  
from some users. People demand to know why feature X wasn't  
implemented yet, or why feature Y was removed. They may keep flaming  
about it long after any worth-while discussion has ended. As a result,  
the developers' time is wasted trying to deal with this person, and so  
even less work gets done. The process becomes extremely frustrating  
after you deal with the same complaint for the 50th time.  

  
  

  
Next time you use a piece of software that someone has put their  
free time into, think about what you can do to show your appriciation.  
Maybe a simple thank-you, or a contribution to the project of your  
own. It may go a long way towards making someone's day a lot better.
