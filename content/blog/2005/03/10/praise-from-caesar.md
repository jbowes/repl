XML honcho Tim Bray says  
[blogging is good for your
career](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/08/BloggingIsGood).  
I feel so validated!  

  
  

Note: this probably won't help you if your (prospective) employer  
thinks XML is just an under-powered, over-hyped dilution of SGML (I  
don't include myself among that group).
