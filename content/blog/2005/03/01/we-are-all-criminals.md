I had heard recently that _Happy Birthday_ was copyrighted,  
but until today I didn't know what exactly this meant. Thank the maker  
for [Unhappy Birthday](http://www.unhappybirthday.com)! Now  
I know how rampant copyright infringement is, and what I can do to  
help stop it.

  
  

  
_Yes, it's satire. Too bad all of it is true._
