As Karen [observed](http://www.sanitycheck.ca/karen/?p=78),  
there are indeed no professors  
blogging on the [planet](http://planet.cs.dal.ca).  
Maybe this is because they are  
unsure of what to blog about. If so, here is a list of blog post  
templates for professors to use:

  
  

  

  * Today, a paper I wrote, entitled $foo, was published in journal $bar
  

  * Star Wars is a good movie, because...
  

  * I released a new version of project $baz today. You can download it from the usual places
  

  * Dear blog, [Singer](http://www.humanexperiments.com) fell asleep in class today. Again.
  
  
  

I hope that helps! Seriously though, I'm more than willing to help  
anyone set up a blog. If you have any reasons why you don't want to be  
on the planet, let me know; maybe we can work around it, and make the  
planet a better website for everyone.
