I got a nice email from  
[Carol Cooke](http://www.blogger.com/profile/5365135) today,  
one of the authors of  
[technogeekery for librarians](http://technogeekery.blogspot.com/).  
She's a Librarian at the University of Manitoba, and is exploring what other
Canadian Universities (and their libraries in particular) are doing with
blogs, in the hopes of getting her University to adopt the technology. I  
wish her the best of luck in this.  

  
  

  
technogeekery for librarians is a pretty good read, and has been added to my  
[blogroll](http://www.bloglines.com/public/bowes). I'd even go so  
far as to suggest that the technogeekery it contains is also for  
armchair librarians, and library enthusiasts.  

  
  

  
In keeping with today's library theme, here are two Open Source  
library/book management programs:  

  
  

  

  * [koha](http://www.koha.org), an Open Source integrated library system.
  

  * [mCatalog](http://mcatalog.sourceforge.net/), a desktop application to catalogue films and books.
