The [CEOS website](http://ceos.dal-acm.ca) is up and  
running (mostly) now. CEOS being the Conference on Engaging in Open  
Source, which will surely become Atlantic Canada's most popular and  
relevant tech conference. Tell all your friends!  

  
  

  
As seen from the sponsors list, CEOS has some heavy hitters  
involved, but in the spirit of giving props where props is due, I must  
put out shoutz and greatz to that perennial blogophobe, Andrew Wong,  
chair of the conference.

By the way, if you needed any more incentive  
to come to CEOS, I've ordered 200+  
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) CDs (including PPC and AMD64), which we will  
distribute at the conference.
