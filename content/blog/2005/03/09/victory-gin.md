I think [this](http://www.mikesmit.com/show_post.php?id=1110418009)  
proves that Mike Smit is [Big Brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
/Nineteen_Eighty-Four).  
I do believe I heard him say that not voting was "doubleplusungood".  
Also: everywhere you look, he's looking back, so...  

  
  

  
Kudos for the online voting system, but I have to wonder about the  
choice of domain name. Surely vote.dsu.ca would have been more  
appropriate, and felt more official.  

  
  

  
One can only assume that Mike plans to make use of the powerful generic nature  
of [his](http://www.whois.ws/whois-com/ivoteonline.com/) domain name  
to gather voting data from a variety of  
demographics, as he expands his system to elections in other student
societies.  
Then, when the time is right, he'll sell it off to, say, burger king.  

  
  

  
  
Yes, I voted. Yes, I did it online. Thanks, Mike!
