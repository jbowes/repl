[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) [2.10](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.10/) was
released today. Yay us!  

  
  

  
I know I push [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) a lot (sorry  
[Phil](http://flame.cs.dal.ca/~pobrien/blog.cgi/),  
but that [gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) fiasco  
today was insane), but if push came to shove I'd be just as happy with  
someone running vanilla  
[Debian](http://www.debian.org),  
[NLD](http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/), or  
[Fedora](http://fedora.redhat.com/). The GNOME desktop is  
the real beauty of these systems, mainly due to its strong focus on  
usability. Accessability, internationalization, and of course the  
community are also aspects of GNOME that matter, to me at least.  

  
  

  
If you haven't used GNOME, or haven't used it recently, you really  
should give it a go. There's a LiveCD  
[available](http://torrent.linux.duke.edu/gnome-livecd-2.10.torrent)  
via bittorrent, for  
anyone who doesn't have a *nix install, or who doesn't want to put  
stuff on their hard drive.  

  
  

  
I think it would be cool to have some of the usability people in  
[CS](http://www.cs.dal.ca) get involved, or even just  
provide some feedback (I'd be willing to listen).
