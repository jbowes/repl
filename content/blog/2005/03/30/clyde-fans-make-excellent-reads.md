title: Clyde Fans Make excellent reads

Reading helps keep the ol' thinkamajig in tip-top shape. Novels  
are my box lunch, but sometimes I like to have steak, or a big mac. In  
this vein, I present the following:

[Make Vol 1](http://make.oreilly.com/01/)  
is the first issue of [O'Reilly's](http://www.oreilly.com)  
new quarterly 'mook'.  
I had originally not intended to get a copy of Make; at $21.99 CAN a  
pop, an issue of Make seemed prohibitively expensive. I happened to  
chance upon a free copy, however; after reading it, I now plan on  
getting a subscription. Make is paper nostalgia for me; it's writing  
your own Commodore Vic 20 games, lusting after a Radio Shack hobby  
electronics kit, playing with legos, or taking apart record  
players. It is all of these things, updated for Today, and wrapped in  
pretty graphics. Some of my favourite articles included "Maker:  
Welcome to the Fab Lab" and "Aerial Kite Photography". Make Vol 1 is  
also of perfect dimensions for reading on the bus, which scores high  
points with me.

[Clyde Fans: Book-1](http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/shopCatalogLong.php?item
=a3fe9b94b553b5),  
by  
[Seth](http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artStudio.php?artist=a3dff7dd55a576),  
is quite good. It's a graphic novel  
(i.e. fancy comic book) about the two brothers who own the Clyde Fans  
Company. I find a lot of the joy I derive from the printed word comes  
as much from the packaging as it does from the content (so long as the  
content could stand on its own). Since the content of Clyde Fans:  
Book-1 is very good, I will write about the packaging of that  
content. Clyde Fans is a cloth-bound hard-cover, the cloth having an  
image of a stand of dead trees on it (which holds some significance to  
the story). The paper is think, manila in colour, and slightly  
glossy. The panels themselves are inked in a pure black, and shades of  
blue-gray. The book jacket is adorned with portraits of the two  
brothers, Abe (front) and Simon (back). The copyright dates, National  
Library of Canada Catalogue information, and related information is  
all hand-printed by Seth; it is a very nice touch.
