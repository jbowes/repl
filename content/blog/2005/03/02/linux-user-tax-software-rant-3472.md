title: 'Linux user tax software rant #3472'
---

Well, it's not so much of a rant, really. More of a suggestion. I  
did my taxes today on the parents' winderz box, no problem. But the  
thing doesn't even use System.Windows.Forms or MFC or whatever they  
call their widget toolkit; it seems like the quiken people are drawing  
custom widgets on a canvas.

  
  

So, why is their software only available for windows? Why not use  
Java or Mono/.Net and draw your pretty custom widgets using the  
canvases in these technologies, or SWT or winforms, or, heaven forbid,  
seperate the logic from the presentation, and make GUIs for each  
platform using that platform's widget set, and following that  
platform's interface guidlines.

  
  

Tax software makers don't make money off the code, they make it off  
the number of returns you do, the correctness of their forms, and any  
extra features (retirement planning, etc). Already you have to  
activate the software online before you can use it, so as long as they  
have a scheme to prevent rampant piracy (moderate piracy is OK :P) of  
their product, things should be fine. Then, the MacOS, bsd, Linux, and,  
uhm, SkyOS users out there can be happy too, without having to leave  
their cutesy little candy-shaped button worlds.

  
  

All you undergrads out there, looking for a software engineering  
project, or directed studies, or business opportunity or something,  
feel free to implement this, hire yourself some accountants, and get  
Netfile certification. Bonus points if you manage to release the code  
under a [DFSG](http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines)  
license (so I can apt-get it), and just charge people per Netfile.  
  

Already, I could probably get away with using an online filing app  
instead. With some google-like javascript magic, they would probably  
be as good as any of the desktop stuff, too. Most people, I would  
guess, just don't like sending their tax infos over the etherweb.
