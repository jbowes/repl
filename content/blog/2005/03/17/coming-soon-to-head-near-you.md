_(That's yours tomorrow, Jon.)_  

  
  

  
Ah, St. Patty's Day... After an incident at the grawood where one  
Dan K. put far too much green in the beer, I've switched to black  
velvets for all my Irish-related holiday needs.  

  
  

  
For the uninitiated, a black velvet is half  
[guinness](http://www.guinness.com/) and half sparkling wine.  
It tastes far better than it sounds, and goes down smooth and bubbly.
