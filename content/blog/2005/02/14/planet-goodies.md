A [few](http://www.mikesmit.com/) [people](http://www.humanexperiments.com/)  
mentioned maybe increasing the number of posts  
visible on the front page of the planet, or perhaps showing two days'  
worth of posts, no matter how many that may be. If anyone else has  
some feelings on this, let me know. In particular, is there any point  
in having the XXL version of the planet?  

  
  

  
In other news, if you want to get a photo manipulated for use as a  
CSHead, post your image on  
[the wiki](http://torch.cs.dal.ca:2004/~johnston/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Community/
PlanetHeads),  
and someone will get to it when they can.
