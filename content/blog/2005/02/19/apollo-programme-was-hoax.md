title: The Apollo Programme was a hoax
---

My girlfriend and I saw  
[Constantine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/) today,  
which was like The Punisher (2004, not 1988) without the suck. The devil
sports some rockin' tattoos

  
  

Snacks for the film included a 15 pack of  
[Mashmallow](http://www.marshmallowpeeps.com/)  
[Peeps](http://www.peepresearch.org/). Those buggers are  
delicious, and they gave me a great idea. So, next time I get some peeps I'm
going to try making a peep sandwich,  
[fluffernutter](http://www.marshmallowfluff.com/htm/fn_frame.shtml) style.
That thing should either be the best tasting sandwich ever, or flat-out kill
me.
