Novell announced a new Free software project today, [hula](http://hula-
project.org). It's got a lot of good things  
going for it, not the least of which being a sexy logo. Mature  
codebase, scalable arcitechture... I could spout lame catch phrases  
about this thing all day. The important part is that the goals include  
making a halfway decent online calendar app, and an open  
DHTML-enriched webmail client (like your very own personal gmail).
