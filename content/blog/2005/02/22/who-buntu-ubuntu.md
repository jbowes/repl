title: Who buntu? Ubuntu!
---

A man of his word, [Mr. Johnston](http://torch.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/cgi-
bin/blog.cgi/) did in fact install  
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) on his  
computer. There were a few hick-ups along the way, but those can be  
attributed to the fact that we used a beta-quality nightly build of  
the install CD, and should not be held against Ubuntu.

  
  

[Phil](http://flame.cs.dal.ca/~pobrien/blog.cgi/)'s laptop,  
on the other hand, was an absolute  
nightmare. Ubuntu, Fedora, Madrake, Gentoo... it Pwn3d them all. Only  
[Vidalinux](http://desktop.vidalinux.com/) actually installed  
with a minimal level of hand-holding. Since it's really just a thin veneer  
atop [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) (they don't even change the  
portage sources, for chrissakes),  
Phil can happily emerge away the rest of his life.

In Planet-related news: We're number one! I encourage everyone to  
place a link to [Planet Dal CS](http://planet.cs.dal.ca) on their personal
interwebs home-a-doodle,  
so hopefully we  
can creep up the google rankings for other permutations of 'Dalhousie  
Computer Science', severely angering  
[Marc](http://www.cs.dal.ca/~comeau/) in the process.
