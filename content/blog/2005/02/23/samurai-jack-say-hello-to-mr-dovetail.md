title: Samurai Jack, say Hello to Mr. Dovetail Saw
---

Sometime during my transit to school yesterday, I lost the cap off  
my USB thumb drive.  
[Phil](http://flame.cs.dal.ca/~pobrien/blog.cgi/)  
provided me with one of those green PS/2 to USB  
connectors, which worked as a cap for a while (i.e. till I got home),  
but considering the relative  
[size](http://www.sandisk.com/retail/cruzer-micro.asp)  
of my thumb drive to one of those things, it looked a little stupid.  

  
  

  
A little stupid was no good at all; it had to be a _lot_ stupid!  
In the end, I turned a perfectly good  
[Samurai Jack](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/samuraijack/)  
Subway toy into my new USB cap (Aku floppy disk coming soon).
