title: Gimping heads for fun and profit

A friend on IRC was asking me how I did some of the CSHeads. Since a picture's
worth a thousand words, a movie must be worth, like, a billion. Allow me to
present a short film for your enjoyment: [gimping smit's
head](http://www.cs.dal.ca/~bowes/smit.avi)  

  
  
Essentially, the process boils down to four steps:  

  

  * Get a photo of a head
  

  * Mess with it in the GIMP
  

  * ???
  

  * Profit!
