By popular demand, the number of posts shown on the front page has  
been increased (to ~~60 or two days' worth, whichever is less~~ 30). I'm also  
looking into removing the time normalization, which, besides making it  
look like [Henry](http://stern.ca) isn't nocturnal, could  
provide some context about where people are.  

  
  

  
** HEY UNDERGRADS, STAFF, AND FACULTY!!!**  
  
Your representation on the Planet is dangerously low. Some of you must have a
blog of some kind, or a desire to start one. In either case, send
[me](mailto:bowes@cs.dal.ca) an email, and I'll help you out.
