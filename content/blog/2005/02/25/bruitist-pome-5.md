On my list of things to do, right after 'write a  
[quoridor](http://www.gigamic.com/jeuxanglais/quoridore.htm)  
clone in C# / GTK#' is 'learn  
[ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org)',  
followed closely by 'learn  
[rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org)'. So, I've been reading  
[Loud Thinking](http://www.loudthinking.com/),  
David Heinemeier Hansson's blog (the creator of RoR).  

  
  

Today, DHH talks about this new RoR based site,  
[odeo](http://www.odeo.com). Odeo isn't live yet, but it looks  
promising. The whole thing revolves around  
[podcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting), letting  
people publish their own feed, or subscribe to feeds based on  
folksonomies, like flikr or del.icio.us.

  
  

  
I'm all for self-publishing and time-shifting. Even on the Internet, larger
media organizations like [slashdot](http://slashdot.org) are always a few days
late when compared to  
[Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net),  
[OSNews](http://www.osnews.com), or any Planet. Sure, you may have to sort
through more items, but that's what the folksonomies are for.  

  
  

  
Once its live, odeo should be a great place to get music, listen to opinion
piecies on new Apple hardware, and hear  
people describe last night's World of Warcraft adventures. Until the  
RIAA tries to shut them down, that is.
