title: 'A Shocking Tale of Lust and Betrayal: Apple and Me'
---

Finally, after being in the shop for a solid month, I got my  
laptop back today. Being a G3 iBook, it had suffered from the dreaded  
[ibook logic board  
failure](http://www.apple.com/ca/support/ibook/faq/), and so the repair was
covered by Apple, even though I  
hadn't purchased the ~~extended warranty~~  
AppleCareâ„¢ for it.

  
  

This is the last straw. I've put up with plenty of crap from their  
hardware, but frankly, the worst part is that there's only one lousy  
company that services Apple products in Halifax, and Apple doesn't  
have their own repair depot in Canada anymore.

  
  

Right here is where I put in a religious rant about selling one's  
soul to Microsoft or Apple, and how FOSS software is the superior  
choice.

  
  

So, the laptop's back, working, and has Ubuntu installed. Speaking  
of which, if anyone wants to get my laptop and me a present (my  
birthday's coming soon!), an Ubuntu  
[bumper sticker](http://www.cafepress.com/ubuntushop.14580811) sure would look  
nice on my iBook.
