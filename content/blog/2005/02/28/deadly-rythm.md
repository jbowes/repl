Today, I went to the hearing and speech clinic. It was the first  
time I've gone in 6 years, and it wasn't too fun. After running the  
tests and charting the results, the audiologist then showed me results  
from today, 6 years ago, and 13 years ago (there were more there, but  
they weren't necessary to make the point). I've been losing my hearing  
at a high rate over the last while, it seems, in both ears. Now, my  
hearing in the 4000Hz to 8000Hz range (the high end) is in the  
"moderate hearing loss" / "(just plain ol') hearing loss" section of  
the handy-dandy guide to hearing. Fun times.
