A workshop proposal submitted by  
[elijah](http://www.gnome.org/~newren/blog/),  
[fer](http://www.gnome.org/~fherrera/blog/),  
[mariano](http://www.gnome.org/~mariano/blog/),  
[pbor](http://www.advogato.org/person/pbor/),  
and I  
was accepted today for this year's [GUADEC](http://www.guadec.org)  
in Stuttgart, Germany. It's about showing new people how to contribute to  
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org). Not that you have to wait till GUADEC to get
involved, you can just point your favorite IRC client at #gnome-love on
GIMPNet &amp;lt/shameless plug&gt;.  

  
  

  
Oh yeah, and they're holding GUADEC in a frickin'
[_castle_](http://www.hausderwirtschaft.de/).
