In the interest of total media saturation, I'm going to post here  
an email I recently sent out:  

  
  
`  

  
Sorry for the late announcement, but here goes:  

  
  

#### The short and sweet announcement (long and bitter follows):

  
  

  
This Monday, June 13, at 6:00 pm in teaching lab 3, the Dal-ACM will be  
hosting a tutorial covering the ins and outs of working on a large  
Open Source project, GNOME. The tutorial will probably last around 2  
hours, and will cover such topics as:  

  
  

  

  * software engineering and development tools use in the GNOME project
  

  * fundamental GNOME libraries
  

  * a GNOME geography lesson
  

  * Free software hacking for fun an profit
  
  
  

  
Don't forget your towel!  

  
  

#### Long and bitter:

  
  

  
I'll be giving a revised and expanded version of the talk I did at GUADEC  
2005. The talk will be a fast-paced wizz-bang overview of everything you  
need to know about GNOME, rapidly devolving into a Q&A session, and  
finishing up with discussion of GNOME bounties and google's summer of  
code, for those of you who want some extra bling.  

  
  

  

  * What GNOME is and why you (as a person and a programmer) should care  
about it.

  

  * Essential mailing lists and websites.
  

  * JHBuild, CVS, and the autotools; GNOME's magic infrastructure.
  

  * Event-based programming and the glib main loop.
  

  * Essential GNOME libraries.
  

  * Freedesktop.org standards, libraries, and applications.
  

  * And much, much more...
  
  
  

  
Admission is free, but your humble presenter always enjoys a bag or two of  
M&Ms.
