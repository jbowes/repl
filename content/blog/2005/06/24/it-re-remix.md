Firefox rules. To see why firefox rules, follow these two steps:  

  
  

  

  * Get [firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/).
  

  * Get [greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/).
  
  
  

  
Now you can start having fun. Possibly the coolest grasemonkey script is  
[Book Burro](http://overstimulate.com/articles/2005/04/24/greasemonkey-book-
burro-find-cheap-books). When viewing a book on amazon.com, barnes and nobel,
etc, Book Burro displays the price of the book from competing websites in a
cool little floating window.  

  
  

  
Last night, I hacked Book Burro to work with chapters.ca and amazon.ca, so now
us Canadians can comparison shop with only a single tab open at once. Get it  
[here](http://www.cs.dal.ca/~bowes/greasemonkey/bookburro.user.js).  

  
  

  
Oh yeah, and there's a wikkid-cool greasemonkey  
[tutorial](http://www.diveintogreasemonkey.org/) available for free from  
[Mark Pilgrim](http://www.diveintomark.org/), if you want to start writing
your own scripts.
