After fighting with my PC for a few hours tonight,  
getting the network and X working again (the price one  
pays for bleeding-edge software), I rolled out a  
[new release](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-
love/2005-June/msg00011.html)  
of gnome-keyring-manager (2.11.1!!). Now if only more programs actually  
used gnome-keyring.  

  
  

  
Obviously, I'm back from Germany now. The whole trip was awesome;  
I'll probably mention it in more detail once I get the photos online.
