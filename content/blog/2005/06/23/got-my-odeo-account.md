I got an invitation to join the [Odeo beta](http://www.odeo.com)  
this morning in my inbox.  

  
  

  
Odeo has three sections: listen, sync, and create. Listen lets you browse for
podcasts, sorted by popularity, age, and so on. Sync lets you manage your
podcast subscriptions, view a list of podcasts from your subscriptions that
you have no let listened to, and download the Odeo syncr, a podcast client
(you can use any client you want, however). Create is not  
yet offered, but will involve creating (via flash, I believe) and  
hosting your own podcast.  

  
  

  
The cool thing about the page for a particular show is that you  
can play the show right in your browser via a flash interface.  
This is great for previewing, or even listening to the whole thing.  

  
  

  
Odeo is one of these new-breed service websites. It's attractive,  
makes effective use of client-side technologies like javascript and  
flash. and does one thing well, in a novel way. It's like  
[flickr](http://www.flickr.com) or  
[backpack](http://www.backpackit.com);  
one of those sites that  
renews your dwindling faith in web developers.  

  
  

  
Odeo is great. If it were a book, I'd give it four and a half out  
of five [baltzerHeads](http://www.dal-acm.ca/ORug/). I hold back the half
baltzerHead because I want to be able to set up a playlist of podcasts online,
and listen to it through the flash interface.
