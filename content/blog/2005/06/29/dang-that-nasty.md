[Mike](http://www.mikesmit.com) was kind enough to  
[point out](http://www.mikesmit.com/show_post.php?id=1120066078)  
the wikkid-cool new [interface](http://www.cs.dal.ca/graduate/gradslide.html)
to the graduate course descriptions page.  

  
  

  
After slapping my forehead a few times, laughing hysterically, having a stiff
drink, then praying to God, I decided I had to take action. I created a
stronger, faster, better than before version using javascript and css,
viewable [here](http://flame.cs.dal.ca/~bowes/bad_flash/gradslide.html).  

  
  

  
My new implementation of the graduate course descriptions page  
retains the hard to use ugly-as-sin interface of the current page, while  
adding the following features:  

  
  

  

  * Content stored in regular google-parsable html.
  

  * No flash, so linux/PPC users will be able to read the content
  

  * No flash, so the disabled can access the content via screen readers, etc
  

  * No flash, so non-english speakers can translate the page content.
  

  * No flash, so you can copy and paste the content.
  

  * The content is still viewable without CSS and javascript.
  
  
  

  
The javascript behind the thing is hacked up
[s5](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/). The faculty is welcome to use
this implementation of the graduate course description interface, completely
free of charge!  

  
  

  
Oh yeah, and Mike gets bonus points on his alpha geek status for relating the
thing to a linked list rather than a slide show.
