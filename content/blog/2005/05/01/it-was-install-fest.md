title: It was an install fest!
---

  
Yesterday, [we](http://www.dal-acm.ca) held the  
[install fest](http://www.dal-acm.ca/Projects/InstallFest) at Dal;  
the consensus was that it rocked. We'll probably hold another one in the  
Fall, to get the Dal froshlings using a better OS.  

  
  

  
There were computers a-plenty, playstation 2 on the big screen,  
and a 1.3Kg bag of M&amp;Ms. I was also introduced to  
[munchkin](http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/game/), an incredibly  
fun card game from  
[Steve Jackson games](http://www.sjgames.com), the same people who brought us  
the  
[War Against The Chtorr](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/chtorr/) RPG.
There's a bit in there about the FBI, cyberpunk, and the EFF;  
GURPS Chtorr is the important part, though.  

  
  

  
As is the custom, many attendees were dressed in their finest geek t-shirts.
