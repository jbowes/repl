I recieved a review copy of  
[Mono: A Developer's Notebook](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/monoadn/)  
through the  
[Dal-ACM](http://www.dal-acm.ca/)'s  
militant arm, our  
own  
[ORUG](http://ug.oreilly.com/).  
The [review](http://dal-acm.ca/ORug/Review20050521)  
is now up on the Dal-ACM web site; the short version is that the book is good.  

  
  

  
Next on the chopping block is [Code Complete](http://www.cc2e.com/). I'm  
already a few hundred pages in, and its been great so far. I can't  
wait to find out who the real killer is.
