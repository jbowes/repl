title: Happy Happy Spam Joy
---

  
[Sean](http://www.livejournal.com/users/msisden/) pointed out  
to me via email that my blog has  
been comment spammed. This makes me happy; I'm high enough on the  
googles to get noticed by spambots.  

  
  

  
The downside is that now I have to deal with it. I think I'll  
evaluate [newsbruiser](http://newsbruiser.tigris.org/)  
(as used on [GNOME  
blogs](http://blogs.gnome.org/nb.cgi/)); it looks like it may have some
capabilities for this, and  
it's written in python.
