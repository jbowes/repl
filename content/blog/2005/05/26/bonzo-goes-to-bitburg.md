I leave for [GUADEC](http://www.guadec.org/) today.  
I'm very excited; not only to I get to go to Europe for the first time  
in my life, and do some exploring with my dad, I also get to meet some  
good friends that I've made over the past year.  

  
  

  
Our (father and I) whirlwind airplane tour begins in Halifax,  
stops briefly in Boston, then Paris, then ends in Stuttgart. It should  
be fun (I like air travel), and dad will no doubt take many good  
pictures from the air.  

  
  

  
GUADEC will be webcast in ogg theora, and we'll probably be on  
IRC, too, so interested parties can watch and comment on my talk,  
live. I'm also going to give a modified version of it to anyone  
interested back home, when I return.
