I don't mean to offend with this; frankly I'm happy when someone  
reads anything at all. I had hoped to stay out of the Dan Brown thing,  
but after seeing  
[Colin's](http://torch.cs.dal.ca/~bate/archive/870/) post,  
and then today seeing a  
friend's MSN name set to something like "Da Vinci Code  
movie... unf unf", it's time to chime in.  

  
  

  
Yes, I've read it. I proudly display my hardcopy on my  
bookshelf. It's just not a good book. Overall, the quality of the  
thing is on par with that of  
[Seal Team Seven: Nucflash](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425148815/q
id=1116436163/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/701-1789523-6533924).  
I was very much surprised to see, a year after finishing reading it, the
revival that has taken place. Somehow, the exact same book was able to return
to the new releases shelf of my local Chapter's. I was not too surprised,
however, to see that there are plans to make a movie based on the subject
matter of The Da Vinci Code, since it's  
_[already been done.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655/)_  

  
  

  
Really, I struggle with what is worse: that the readers of this book believe
the subject matter is real, or that Dan Brown believes it to be real. Good job
on the research there, Danno.  

  
  

  
Anyways, here's a quick list of books from my library that are far better than
Danno's 450 pages of effluvia. I will try to relate them to The Da Vinci Code
based on some common theme.  

  
  

  
Modern day books with an equivalent level of factual historical basis:

  

  

  * [Neverwhere, by Neil Gaiman](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380789019/qid=1116436314/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/701-1789523-6533924)
  
  
  

Books where the protagonist has an obscure occupation:

  

  

  * [Eastern Standard Tribe, by Cory Doctorow](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765310457/qid=1116436380/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_0_1/701-1789523-6533924)
  

  * [Pattern Recognition, by William Gibson](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425198685/qid=1116436411/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/701-1789523-6533924)
  
  
  

  
Books with pretty pictures (if you have the illustrated version of The Da
Vinci Code):

  

  

  * [Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, by Susanna Clarke](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747574111/ref=pd_bxgy_text_1/701-1789523-6533924)
  

  * [Maus I and II, by Art Spiegalman](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679748407/qid=1116436605/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/701-1789523-6533924)
