For anyone looking for  
[Moleskine notebooks](http://www.modoemodo.com/)  
in Halifax, Nova  
Scotia, they're stocking them at Frog Hollow Books. Frog Hollow  
doesn't seem to have a website, so here's their meatspace location:  

  
  
  
Frog Hollow Books Ltd.  
5657 Spring Garden Rd.  
Halifax, Nova Scotia  
B3J 3R4  
  
  

  
_Requisite google maps link: [Frog Hollow Books](http://maps.google.com/maps?q
=5657+spring+garden+road+halifax&spn=0.007317,0.009388&t=k&hl=en) (They're in
Park Lane)._  

  
  

  
This was another added benefit from the  
[Install Fest](http://www.dal-acm.ca/Projects/InstallFest/)  
on Saturday;  
[CS Society](http://www.cssociety.ca)  
Summer President David Nichols had a moleskine with him.
