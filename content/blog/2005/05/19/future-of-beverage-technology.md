For years, we Canadians have envied our American neighbors. Our  
[Mountain Dew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_dew) was caffine free;
theirs was one of the most caffinated  
beverages available, second only to  
[Jolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolt_Cola).  

  
  

  
No longer do we have to make expensive trips to the states or pay  
dewrunners to haul loads in their boats! Mountain Dew Energy is  
now available in stores!

It's good. It doesn't taste exactly like regular Mountain Dew, but  
neither does American Mountain Dew. I fully expect CS test scores at  
Dal to rise dramatically with the introduction of this new product.
