[Buckler](https://github.com/jbowes/buckler) is
[Shields](https://github.com/olivierlacan/shields) as a Service (ShaaS, or
alternatively, Badges as a Service) for use in GitHub READMEs, or anywhere
else. Use Buckler with your favorite continuous integration tool, performance
monitoring service API, or ridiculous in-joke to surface information.  
  
Buckler is MIT licensed. You are free to:  

  * Host your own version of Buckler.
  * Download and re-serve generated shields.
  * Link directly to [b.repl.ca](http://b.repl.ca/) for static information display (eg licensing details).
  * Redirect to [b.repl.ca](http://b.repl.ca/) from another service for dynamic information (eg build status).
