---

If you're obfuscating your [Android](http://android.com/) applications using
[ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/), make sure to keep the
_proguard/_ directory at the root of your Android project under revision
control. This may seem contrary to what you'd feel like doing, as the files
are autogenerated, but it will help if you ever need to debug a stack trace
from your published application.

  

Typically when I'm ready to release, and after I've done every other change, I
will bump the revision in my _AndroidManifest.xml_ and generate a new .apk
from eclipse, then test it out on my device. If everything looks good, I'll
commit the manifest change, along with the now updated proguard directory,
with a commit message containing the release number. Then I'll tag that commit
with the same name. This way, if that release ever has any exceptions I need
to debug, I can download the obfuscated stack trace from the Android developer
console, run _git checkout &lt;TAGNAME&gt;_, and use the proguard files from
that release to deobfuscate the strack trace.

  

Keeping the proguard files under git makes them quickly and easily accessible,
should you ever require them.
