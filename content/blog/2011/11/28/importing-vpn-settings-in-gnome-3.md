title: Importing VPN Settings in GNOME 3
---

I've noticed after upgrading my workstation to Fedora 16 that GNOME 3's
default NetworkManager UI doesn't expose the old UI's import option for VPN
settings. I have my old OpenVPN settings file on hand, so I'd rather not type
it out again.  
  
Turns out you can still access the old UI and its convenient import button by
running _nm-connection-editor._
