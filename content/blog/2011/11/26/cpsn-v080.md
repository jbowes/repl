This is just a quick update to CPSN, fixing detection of stale cookies. It
will also prompt you for a username and password if you forget to put one in
the settings file (or don't want to save your password on disk).  
  
Install it with gem install --user cpsn  
Check the included README for details on configuration.

_**Note:** Using CPSN probably violates any number of Terms of Service, etc.
Use at your own risk._
