I've finally gotten around to fixing up cpsn to work against Sony's latest
website version. CPSN is a cli app that lets you check if your PlayStation
Friends are online, and what games they're playing so you can, for example,
see if anybody is playing Call of Duty without leaving the comfort of your
shell.  
  
Install it with gem install --user cpsn  
Check the included README for details on configuration.  
  
Git: <https://github.com/jbowes/cpsn>  
  
_**Note: **Using CPSN probably violates any number of Terms of Service, etc.
Use at your own risk._
