title: HOWTO Make a USB Y Cable for Host Mode
---

  
Many smartphones or tablets support USB host mode (or On The Go mode) with an
adapter. Unfortunately, a lot of those devices don't supply power to their
client USB devices; you can't just plug a host mode adapter into an HP
TouchPad, for example, then plug a keyboard into the host mode adapter, and
expect everything to work.  
  
I put up a video on youtube explaining how to build and use a USB Y cable to
inject power to the client devices. If you'd like, you can [watch it
