title: Possibly a Bad Generator Definition?
---

  
As I obliquely  
[alluded to](http://flame.cs.dal.ca/~bowes/blog.cgi/tech/psa.html)  
the other day, big things are happening. I'm resigning from my  
[current](http://www.abridean.com "The little local guys." )  
[job](http://www.ncipher.com "Owned by these guys." )  
as a software developer. Ms. Vissers and I are packing  
up and leaving the province. The country, in fact. We're moving to  
[North Carolina](http://www.visitnc.com/).  

  
  

  
I got a job at  
[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com "Insert Antitrust quote here." ).  

  
  

  
I'll be working as a software engineer on  
[Red Hat Network](http://www.redhat.com/en_us/USA/rhn/ "Not just for security
updates!" ).  
The product sounds interesting, and the technologies involved sound fun.  
Oh yeah, and the develop on Linux ;)  

  
  

  
I'm pretty pumped about it. Obviously it's a huge change, and I'll  
miss everyone here very much, but it's also going to be very fun; kind  
of an adventure.  

  
  

  
One of the hard parts in the decisions was definitely leaving abridean.  
There's a good bunch of people there, and I'll miss them.
