Ms. Vissers (now Mrs. Vissers-Bowes) and I got married on May 20th, 2006. We
flew back to Halifax for  
the ceremony; it was a beautiful day. I love her, and it was definitely the
best  
day of my life.

This week we expanded our family.  
[Julius](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bowes/sets/72157594181452474/)  
is our new baby boy. So far Spook has been a little scared of him, but we're  
taking the introduction slow. Hopefully they will get along.  

  
  

  
In software related news, [herk](http://www.fnordia.org) and I have  
been working on  
[Dangerously Incompetent](http://www.dangerouslyinc.com).  
Our goal is to create a small community site, centered around  
a few FOSS projects, book reviews, and articles. If only I grokked drupal.  

  
  

  
Also, I have [Mugshot](http://www.mugshot.org) invites. If you want one, send
me an email.
