Got an email to my Comp Sci account from a [Keane](http://www.keane.com)
recruiter  
today. It was very generic; my name wasn't in the email, and it said they were  
hiring for basically every position under the sun, and my skills matched
those.  
I sent a reply saying that I was happily employed and no longer living in the  
area, but thanks for asking and good luck in your search!

  
  

  
The email was total spam, and even if I was looking for a job the nature of
this email would have completely turned me off. I can't see how they think
such tactics will net them any employees of any worth.
