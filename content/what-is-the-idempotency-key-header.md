- summary of what it is (for ops that need idempotentcy but aren't natively so, plus what the heck idempotency is
- who uses it
- the draft spec
- *why* its used (high value txns, interaction with outside world, prevent dupes)
- don't let idempotency purity get in the way of utility (let the user know its a dupe)
- it should be a fallback (teaser to further posts?)
